# Mission Training Optimizer Project
In our Software Engineering class we were provided a list of clients and the products they would like us to complete. For our project, the team chose to do a Mission Training Optimizer with the USAF. The client requested a database with an API to converse with it. Additionally, they want the abilty to visualize any trends in the data. They also expressed a desire for only certain members to have the right to edit the database, while other members will only be able to see the data in the database and the visualized data. To give the client a visualization of their data, we used PowerBI to interface with our database to present the data in an easy-to-analyze format.
Handling user authorization

To enter the site, a user must have an existing login. These are created alongside the admins to ensure they have total control of who can access the sensitive data. If the user is not authorized to make changes, they will only have access to the PowerBI reports and the ability to see the raw contents of the database. If the user does have editing access, they will have the ability to input data into a database through Excel sheets and via manual uploads. This allows the user to perform mass uploads of their previously tracked data, or enter in new data in a form built to match the Excel sheet format. If an authorized user accidentally inserts incorrect information into the database, a user with admin privledges must go in and fix the change through an update or by deleting the entry all together. This gives admins the final say about what should be in the database.
